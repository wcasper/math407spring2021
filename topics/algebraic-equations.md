Consider the set $$G$$ of complex-valued solutions of an algebraic equation $$z^n=1$$.  If $$z=a$$ is a solution (ie. $$a^n=1$$), and $$z=b$$ is also a solution, then $$(ab)^n = a^nb^n=1\cdot 1 = 1$$ and therefore $$z = ab$$ is also a solution.  Furthermore if $$a\in G$$ then $$(1/a)^n = 1/a^n = 1$$ and so $$z=1/a$$ is a solution.  In other words, if $$a,b\in G$$ then $$ab\in G$$ and if $$a\in G$$ then $$a^{-1}\in G$$.  Thus $$G$$ is a group.

More generally, we can think about the set of roots of any polynomial equation $$p(z) = 0$$.  Associated to any such equation is a very special group called the [Galois Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois_group), which we will discuss later in this course.
