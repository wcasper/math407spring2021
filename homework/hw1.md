### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF.

Problem 1: (Fraleigh Section 0 Problem 11) List the elements in $$\{a,b,c\}\times\{1,2,c\}$$.

Problem 2: (Fraleigh Section 0 Problem 12) Let $$A=\{1,2,3\}$$ and $$B=\{2,4,6\}$$.  For each relation between $$A$$ and $$B$$, specified as a subset of the cartesian product $$A\times B$$, decide if the relation is a function from $$A$$ to $$B$$.  If it is, decide whether it is one-to-one and whether it is onto.

* (A) $$\{(1,4),(2,4),(3,6)\}$$
* (B) $$\{(1,6),(1,2),(1,4)\}$$
* (C) $$\{(1,6),(2,6),(3,6)\}$$
* (D) $$\{(1,4),(2,6),(3,4)\}$$
* (E) $$\{(2,2),(1,6),(3,4)\}$$
* (F) $$\{(1,2),(2,6),(2,4)\}$$

Problem 3:  Let $$A$$ be the set consisting of the standard 52 playing cards, and let $$\mathscr R$$ be a relation on $$A$$ defined by

$$x\mathscr{R}y\quad\text{if and only if}\quad \text{$x$ and $y$ have the same suit}$$

Show that $$\mathscr R$$ is an equivalence relation.  Explicitly describe the equivalence classes in the associated partition.

Problem 4:  Let $$\mathcal C(\mathbb R)$$ denote the set of all differentiable functions on $$\mathbb R$$.  Define a relation $$\mathscr R$$ on $$\mathcal C(\mathbb R)$$ by

$$f(x)\mathscr{R} g(x)\quad\text{if and only if}\quad f(3)=g(3)$$

Show that $$\mathscr{R}$$ is an equivalence relation.
