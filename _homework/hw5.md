### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* printed in barely-legible script using a gourmet custom t-shirt maker from Etsy in true hipster fashion

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:** Find, up to isomorphism, all abelian groups of order $$1089$$

**Problem 2:** Find all cosets of the subgroup $$\langle 18\rangle$$ in the gropu $$\mathbb Z_{36}$$

**Problem 3:** Give an example of a group $$G$$ whose order is not prime and which is not isomorphic to any direct product of its nontrivial proper subgroups.

**Problem 4:** Let $$G$$ be a finite abelian group.  Show that if $$G$$ is not cyclic, then $$G$$ contains a subgroup isomorphic to $$\mathbb Z_p\times \mathbb Z_p$$ for some prime number $$p>1$$.

**Problem 5:** Show that if $$G$$, $$H$$ and $$K$ are groups and $$G\times K\cong H\times K$$, then $$G\cong H$$

**Problem 6:** For each of the following, give an example or explain why no example exists.
* A subgroup $$H$$ of an infinite group $$G$$ where $$H$$ has finitely many left cosets
* A subgroup of a group of order $$6$$, which has $$6$$ left cosets
* A subgroup of a group of order $$6$$, which has $$12$$ left cosets
* A subgroup of a group of order $$6$$, which has $$4$$ left cosets

**Problem 7:**  

Suppose that $$G$$ is a group (possibly infinite) and that $$H$$ is a subgroup of $$G$$.  Show that the cardinality of the set of left cosets of $$G$$ is the same as the cardinality of the set of right cosets.

**Problem 8:**

The **center of a group $$G$$** is the set

$$Z(G) = \{x\in G: ax=xa\ \forall a\in G\}.$$

Suppose that $$G$$ is a group of order $$pq$$ with $$p$$ and $$q$$ prime.  In this problem, we will show that if $$Z(G)$$ is nontrivial, then $$G$$ is a cyclic group in a series of steps. 

* Show that if $$G$$ is not a cyclic group and $$a\neq e$$ then the order of $$\langle a\rangle$$ is either $$p$$ or $$q$$.
* Show that if $$G$$ is not a cyclic group, then for all $$a,b\in G$$ either $$\langle a\rangle = \langle b\rangle$$ or $$\langle a\rangle\cap\langle b\rangle = \{e\}.$$
Assume that $$x,y\in G$$ with $$e\neq x\in Z(G)$$ and $$y\notin \langle x\rangle$$.  Without loss of generality, assume that the order of $$\langle x\rangle$$ is $$p$$ and the order of $$\langle y\rangle$$ is $$q$$.  Prove that the map

$$\mathbb Z_p\times\mathbb Z_q\rightarrow G,\quad (j,k)\mapsto x^jy^k$$

is an isomorphism.
* Use the previous result to prove that if $$Z(G)\neq \{e\}$$, then $$G$$ must be cyclic.
