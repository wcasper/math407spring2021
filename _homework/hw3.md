### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* inscribed on the wing of a B-52 based at Area 51 in Roswell, New Mexico

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:**  Find all subgroups of the given group

* $$\mathbb Z_8$$
* $$\mathbb Z_{12}$$
* $$\mathbb Z_{17}$$

**Problem 2:**  An **automorphism** of a group $$G$$ is an isomorphism from $$G$$ to itself.  Find all automorphisms of each of the following groups

* $$\mathbb Z_8$$
* $$\mathbb Z_{84}$$
* $$\mathbb Z$$


**Problem 3:**  Let $$G$$ be a group and let $$S\subseteq G$$.  Show that

$$H_S = \{x\in G: xa = ax\ \text{for all $a\in S$}\}$$

is a subgroup.  Show that in the special case $$S=G$$ that $$H_S=H_G$$ is abelian.  The subgroup $$H_G$$ is called the **center** of $$G$$.

**Problem 4:**  Suppose that $$G\subseteq\mathbb R^3$$ is a group with binary operation $$*$$ satisfying the following property
* if $$a\times b\neq 0$$, then $$a*b = a\times b$$ (where the latter denotes the cross product)

Prove that $$a*b=0$$ for all $$a,b\in G$$.

**Problem 5:**  Recall that the **dihedral group** $$D_n$$ is

$$D_n = \{(a,j): a\in \mathbb Z_n\quad\text{and}\ j=\pm 1\}$$

with the binary operation $$(a,j)*(b,k) = (ak+_nb,jk)$$.

Draw the Cayley graph for the dihedral group $$D_6$$ with generating set $$S = \{(1,1),(0,-1)\}$$.

**Problem 6:**  Let $$G = \mathbb C^\times$$ be the group  of nonzero complex numbers with binary operation given by multiplication.  Prove that if $$H$$ is a finite subgroup of $$G$$, then for some $$n$$

$$H = \{z\in\bbc: z^n=1\}.$$
