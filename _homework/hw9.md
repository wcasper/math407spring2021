### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* buried somewhere in the belly of the next update to the Apple ITunes Terms of Service agreement

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:** 

Suppose that $$E$$ is an extension field of $$F$$.

* (a) Define what it means for $$E$$ to be a splitting field of a polynomal $$f(x)\in F[x]$$.
* (b) Define what it means for $$E$$ to be a separable extension of $$F$$.
* (c) Define what it means for $$E$$ to be a normal extension of $$F$$.
* (d) Define what it means for $$E$$ to be a Galois extension of $$F$$.

**Problem 2:**
Give examples of each of the following

* (a) A field $$F$$ and a field extension $$E$$ which is separable but not normal.
* (b) A field $$F$$ and a field extension $$E$$ which is normal but not separable.
* (c) A field $$F$$ and a field extension $$E$$ of infinite degree.

**Problem 3:**

Let $$E = \mathbb Q[\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5}]$$.  Determine each of the following

* (a) The degree of the extension $$[E:\mathbb Q]$$
* (b) The degree of the extension $$[E:\mathbb Q[\sqrt{2}]]$$
* (c) The explicit values of the elements of the Galois group $$G(E/\mathbb Q)$$ and what group we have seen before that this is isomorphic to.

**Problem 4:**

Consider the polynomial $$f(x) = x^3+2\in \mathbb Q[x]$$.

* (a) Determine the splitting field $$E$$ of $$f(x)$$.
* (b) Draw the lattice of intermediate fields between $$E$$ and $$\mathbb Q$$.
* (c) Determine explicitly each of the elements of the Galois group of $$f(x)$$, ie. $$G(E/\mathbb Q)$$.  What group that we have seen before is this Galois group isomorphic to?
* (d) Draw the lattice of subgroups of the Galois group.
* (e) Use colors or symbols to indicate on the diagrams from (b) and (d) which subgroups correspond to which subfields under the Fundamental Theorem of Galois theory.

**Problem 5:**

Let $$E$$ be a separable and normal extension of a field $$F$$.  For any $$a\in E$$ we define the **norm** $$N_{E/F}(a)$$ and **trace** $$Tr_{E/F}(a)$$ of $$a$$ over $$F$$ to be

$$N_{E/F}(a) = \prod_{\sigma\in G(E/F)} \sigma(a)$$

$$T_{E/F}(a) = \sum_{\sigma\in G(E/F)}  \sigma(a).$$

* (a) Prove that for any $$a\in E$$ both $$N_{E/F}(a)$$ and $$T_{E/F}(a)$$ are elements of $$F$$.
* (b) Let $$E = \mathbb Q(\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3})$$.  Calculate the norm and trace over $$\mathbb Q$$ of each of the following elements of $$E$$: $$2$$, $$\sqrt{2}$$, $$\sqrt{6}$$, and $$\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3}$$.
