### Directions
Solve the following problems and type up your solutions.  Your solutions should be provided in one of the following formats (in order of preference)
* typed up in $$\LaTeX$$ and submitted as a PDF on Canvas
* written legibly on blank paper, scanned into a PDF and then uploaded on Canvas
* hidden behind a flux capacitor in a Delorean going just under $$88$$ miles per hour

If you go with the first strategy, you may wish to check out Overleaf which is a free and intuitive website for generating $$\LaTeX$$ documents online.
If you wish to use the second method and don't own a scanner at home, you can check out the numerous scanning apps available for smartphones.

**Problem 1:** Classify each of the following finitely generated abelian groups by determining an isomorphic group in either prime divisor or invariant factor form.
* $$(\mathbb Z_4\oplus\mathbb Z_4\oplus\mathbb Z_8)/\langle (1,2,4)\rangle$$
* $$(\mathbb Z\oplus\mathbb Z)/\langle (0,1)\rangle$$
* $$(\mathbb Z\oplus \mathbb Z\oplus \mathbb Z)/(\langle (3,3,3)\rangle)$$
* $$(\mathbb Z\oplus\mathbb Z\oplus \mathbb Z_2)/\langle(1,1,1)\rangle$$

**Problem 2:** In the group $$\mathbb Z_{24}$$ let $$H = \langle 4\rangle$$ and $$N = \langle 6\rangle$$.

a) List the elements in $$H+N$$

b) list the cosets in $$(H+N)/N$$, showing the elements in each coset

c) List the cosets in $$H/(H\cap N)$$ showing the elements in each coset

d) Give the correspondence between $$H/(H\cap N)$$ and $$(H+N)/N$$ guaranteed by the Second Isomorphism Theorem.

**Problem 3:** In the group $$\mathbb Z_{24}$$ let $$H = \langle 4\rangle$$ and $$K = \langle 8\rangle$$.

a) List the elements in $$G/H$$, showing the elements in each coset

b) List the cosets in $$G/K$$, showing the elements in each coset

c) List the cosets in $$H/K$$, showing the elements in each coset

d) List the cosets in $$(G/K)/(H/K)$$, showing the elements in each coset

e) Give the correspondence between $$(G/K)/(H/K)$$ and $$G/H$$ guaranteed by the Third Isomorphism Theorem.

**Problem 4:** In a quantum computer, data is stored in **qubits**, which mathematically are represented by elements $$\binom{z}{w}\in\mathbb C^2$$.  A quantum computer modifies a single qubit using **1-qubit quantum circuits**, which mathematically are represented by $$2\times 2$$ matrices in the **projective general linear group**

$$\text{PGL}_2(\mathbb C) = \text{GL}_2(\mathbb C)/\{zI: z\in \mathbb C^\times\}.$$

Prove that $$\text{PGL}_2(\mathbb C)$$ is also isomorphic to the **projective special linear group**

$$\text{PSL}_2(\mathbb C) = \text{SL}_2(\mathbb C)/\{\pm I\}.$$

**Problem 5:** A **Mobius transformation** is a complex valued function $$\chi$$ of the form $$\chi(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}$$ for some complex numbers $$a,b,c,d\in\mathbb C$$ with $$ad\neq bc$$.  Prove that the set $$\mathcal M$$ of all Mobius transformations is a group under composition.  This group is called the **Mobius group**.  Prove that $$|mathcal M$$ is isomorphic to $$\text{PGL}_2(\mathbb C)$$.
