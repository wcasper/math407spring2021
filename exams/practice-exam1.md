Solve each of the following problems.
If the problem asks for a proof, be sure to carefully justify your work, including any theorems from class.

Note: you may NOT use a theorem or result from class to prove something when it makes the problem entirely trivial.  If you are unsure whether a particular theorem or result is allowed, just ask!

## Problem 1 (True or False)

For each of the following, write TRUE if the statement is true and FALSE if the statement is false.  NO explanation is needed.

a) Up to isomorphism, there are exactly two abelian groups of order $$60$$

b) If $$G$$ is a group of order $$6$$ then $$G$$ is abelian

c) If $$\varphi: G\rightarrow H$$ is a group homomorphism, then $$\varphi(g^{-1}) = (\varphi(g))^{-1}$$ for all $$g\in G$$

d) If $$G$$ is not a cyclic group, then $$G$$ has a nontrivial proper subgroup.

e) If $$H\leq G$$ and $$a,b\in G$$ then $$a^2H = b^2H$$

## Problem 2

a) State Cayley's Theorem.

b) Write the definition of an equivalence relation $$\mathscr R$$ on a set $$A$$.

c) Give an example of a set $$S$$ with a binary operation $$\star$$ that is not associative.

## Problem 3

Find all subgroups of $$S_3$$.

## Problem 4

Let $$G$$ be the finite abelian group

$$G = \{k: 0\leq k\leq 11,\ \text{and}\ \text{$k$ and $12$ are relatively prime}\}$$

with group operation given by *multiplication* modulo 12.  Determine which finitely generated abelian group in prime divisor form that $$G$$ is isomorphic to.  Prove that $$G$$ is isomorphic to the group you determined.

## Problem 5

Prove that if $$G$$ is a finite group of prime order $$p$$, then $$G$$ is a cyclic group.

## Problem 6

Let $$H$$ and $$K$$ be subgroups of a group $$G$$.  Define a relation $$\sim$$ on $$G$$ via

$$a\sim b\ \Leftrightarrow\ a=hbk\ \text{for some $h\in H$ and $k\in K$}.$$

Prove that $$\sim$$ is an equivalence relation.

## Problem 7

Let $$G$$ be a group and $$H$$ and $$K$$ be subgroups of $$G$$.  Prove that if $$H$$ and $$K$$ both have order $$7$$, then either $$H=K$$ or else $$H\cap K = \{e\}$$.
