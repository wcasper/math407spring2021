## Cartesian Product of Groups

Recall the definition of the **cartesian product** of sets

**Definition:** The **cartesian product** of a collection of sets $$A_1,\dots,A_n$ is the set

$$\prod_{i=1}^n A_i = \{(a_1,a_2,\dots,a_n): a_i\in A_i\ \forall\ 1\leq i\leq n\}.$$

The cartiesian product $$\prod_{i=1}^nG_i$$ of a collection of groups $$G_1,\dots,G_n$$ can also be given the structure of a finite group in a few ways.
The simplest way is to define

$$(g_1,g_2,\dots,g_n)(g_1',g_2',\dots,g_n') = (g_1g_1',g_2g_2',\dots,g_ng_n').$$

**Definition:** The group $$\prod_{i=1}^nG_i$$ with binary operation defined above is called the **product group** or the **direct product of the groups**.

When each $$G_i$$ is abelian and the group operation is denoted as $$+$$, we sometimes will also see this additive notation adopted

$$(g_1,g_2,\dots,g_n)+(g_1',g_2',\dots,g_n') = (g_1g_1',g_2g_2',\dots,g_ng_n')$$

and we may call the product group the **direct sum of the groups$$ and denote it by $$\oplus_{i=1}^n G_i$$.


**Example:**
The group $$\mathbb Z_3\times \mathbb Z_2$$ has the group operation

$$(a,b)+(c,d) = (a+b,c+d).$$

The dihedral group $$D_3$$ has the same underlying set, but has a very different binary operation!

**Example:**
The group $$\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_3$$ is a finite abelian group of order $$4$$ but is *not* isomorphic to $$\mathbb Z_4$$.  Why not?

**Example:**
The group $$\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_3$$ is a finite abelian group of order $$6$$ and is isomorphic to $$\mathbb Z_6$$.

**Example:**
The set $$\mathbb Z^r = \mathbb Z\times\mathbb Z\times\dots\times\mathbb Z$$ is a direct sum of $$n$$ copies of the abelian group $$\mathbb Z$$
