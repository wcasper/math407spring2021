### Basic definition

Suppose that $$(G,*)$$ and $$(G,\star)$$ are two sets with binary relations.  Sometimes, these sets will be basically the same in a certain sense.  For example, there is obviously very little difference between

$$G = \{0,1,2,3,\dots,11\}\quad \text{with the binary relation $+_{12}$}\}$$

and the set

$$H = \{x| \text{$x$ is an hour on a clock}\}\quad \text{with the binary relation of adding hours}$$

Mathematically, the way we express this kind of equivalence is through isomorphisms.

**Definition:**  An **isomorphism** from $$(G,*)$$ to $$(H,\star)$$ is a bijection $$f: G\rightarrow H$$ satisfying

$$f(a*b) = f(a)\star f(b)\quad\text{for all $a,b\in G$}.$$

In other words, it's a bijection which is compatible with the binary relations.
