## Definitions and Examples

Let $$G$$ be a group with binary operation $$*$$ and identity $$e$$.

**Proposition:** Let $$a\in G$$.  Then the set

$$\langle a\rangle = \{a^k: k\in \mathbb Z\}$$

is a group.  Here $$a^k = a*a*\dots* a$$ is the product of $$k$$ copies of $$a$$.

**Proof:**  Recall that it suffices to show $$x*y^{-1}$$ for all $$x,y\in \langle a\rangle$$.  For $$j,k\in \mathbb Z$$, we have $$a^j*(a^k)^{-1} = a^j*a^{-k} = a^{j-k}\in \langle a\rangle$$, so we are done.

**Definition:**  The group $$\langle a\rangle$$ is called the  **cyclic subgroup of $$G$$ generated by $$a$$**.

If $$G = \langle a\rangle$$ then we say **$$a$$ generates $$G$$** or that **$$a$$ is a generator for $$G$$**.  If $$G$$ is generated by a single element, then $$G$$ is called **cyclic**.

**Example:**  The group $$\mathbb Z_n = \{0,1,2,\dots, n-1\}$$ is cyclic, and is generated by $$1$$.  In fact $$\mathbb Z_n = \langle k\rangle$$ for any $$0<k<n$$ relatively prime to $$n$$.

**Example:**  The set

$$H = \left\lbrace
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -1\\ 1 & 0\end{array}\right),\ 
\left(\begin{array}{cc}-1 &  0\\ 0 &-1\end{array}\right),\ 
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 &  1\\-1 & 0\end{array}\right),\ 
\left(\begin{array}{cc} 1 &  0\\ 0 & 1\end{array}\right)
\right\rbrace$$

is a cyclic subgroup of $$\text{GL}_n(\mathbb R)$$ generated by $$\left(\begin{array}{cc} 0 & -1\\ 1 & 0\end{array}\right)$$.

## Properties of Cyclic Groups

**Theorem:** If $$G$$ is a cyclic group, then $$G$$ is abelian.

**Theorem:** If $$G$$ is a cyclic group, then either $$G$$ is infinite and is isomorphic to $$\mathbb Z$$, or else $$G$$ is finite and isomorphic to $$\mathbb Z_n$$ for $$n = |G|$$.

**Theorem:** If $$G$$ is a cyclic group generated by $$a$$ and $$H$$ is a subgroup, then $$H$$ is also cyclic and $$H = \langle a^k\rangle$$ for some $$k\geq 0$$.  Moreover if $$G$$ is infinite and $$k\neq 0$$, then $$H$$ is infinite.  If $$G$$ is finite of order $$n$$, then $$|H|$$ is the greatest common divisor of $$k$$ and $$n$$.  In particular $$|H|$$ divides $$|G|$$.
