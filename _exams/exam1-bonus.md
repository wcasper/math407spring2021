## Mulligan!
Redo one of the problems from Exam 1.  You will be able to acquire bonus points potentially up to the value of the number of points on the exam that you missed for that particular problem.  Note that since you have plenty of time to think of your solution, your new solution is expected to be well-written and clearly explained.

You may work with other students or ask for help from your professor.  However, you may not look up solutions online.
